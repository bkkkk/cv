PhD Particle Physics	Sep 2010 — May 2015	Royal Holloway, University of London	Egham, UK	Focused on assessing the performance of a particle identification algorithm and its implementation in various analyses.
PhD Particle Physics	Sep 2010 — May 2015	Royal Holloway, University of London	Egham, UK	Implemented three data analysis projects using C++ and bash to interpret large quantities of collected data using the world-wide Grid system. Leveraged unit-testing and TDD to ensure the robustness of the results.
